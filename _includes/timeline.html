    <h2 class="intro-header__title">What are Biometrics Zombies?</h2><br>
    <p class="intro__content-desc">Why won’t dead  - and violent - ideas just die? Time and again we kill them, debunk them out of existence, but they keep coming back, deadlier than ever, and with alluring new names and claims. Our grandparents called it eugenics, but we call it biometrics. Our forefathers called it craniology and our aunties called it ___ and today the kids call it machine learning. In the 1960’s we thought criminality came from large Y chromosomes but in the 21st century we’re pretty sure it’s kept in the proportions of one’s face. We keep building gadgets to track people we consider risky or deviant, even as...<br><br>

[[emphasizing the consistent through-line across decades. A continuous genealogy of the same intellectual current, while they may seem disparate]]
<br><br>
These zombie ideas are deadly. They are at the core of our violent racist, capitalist, hetero-patriarchical society. So why won’t these dead ideas just die? Because funders, institutions, and companies keep resurrecting them for profit. There are careers to be made in reviving zombie ideas, dealing in death is a profitable trade. And people refuse to learn from the lessons of the past. We keep acting like tired recycled ideas are radical innovations, when really it’s just more of the same.

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1775</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Blumenbach described five human varieties: Caucasians, Mongolians, Ethiopians, Americans, and Malays. Saini points out that "his arbitrary classification would have lasting consequences," as evidenced by the now-common use of "caucasian" to politely describe whiteness.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1886</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">A revival of interest in phrenology occurred during the early 20th century, partly because of studies of evolution, criminology and anthropology (as pursued by Cesare Lombroso). Despite being widely debunked, Lombroso's ideas about criminality - and that criminal propensity or behavior could be inferred through the analyses of bodily forms - form the basis of the field of criminology. This work is regularly cited by modern research into criminality prediction with biometrics.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">This notable entrant to the physiognomic ring features characteristics the author thought were "genuine" and "unreliable." That dichotomy bears a striking resemblance to language used in modern facial recognition papers: "genuine" and "impostor."</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Funded by John D. Rockefeller and the Carnegie Institution, the Eugenics Record Office was founded in 1910 on Long Island. The ERO analysed ranges of physical to tempermantal properites through questionnaires with "a commitment to improve race-betterment." In the US, ERO work (propoganda) led to forced sterilization of individuals with "undesirable" characteristics.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Schwitzgebel defined behavioral engineering as "the application of electromechanical technology to the understanding maintenance, and modification of human behavior."  He encouraged the use of portable electric shock devices to suppress smoking, nail biting, bad posture, homosexuality and drug addiction. This work extended the reach of the carceral state by drawing on the work of behavioral psychology to justify the dehumanizing treatement of people labeled as "delinquents" or "criminals."</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Authors of The Bell Curve argued that intelligence had a lot to with some of society's most pressing social problems, such as poverty, crime, and low educational achievement. They claimed that evidence points "toward a genetic factor in conitive ethnic differences" because "blacks and white differ most on tests" measuring "general intelligence," which they characterized as a fixed, inherited index of mental capacity.</p>
