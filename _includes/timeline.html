      <div class="timeline__content"><img class="timeline__img" src="/assets/img/timeline/blumenbach_1775.png" alt='A drawing of five slightly distinctly-shaped human skulls. Below each skull is a number and word: "1. Tangusae," "2. Caribaei," "3. Feminae Georgianae," "4. Otakeitae," and "5. Aethiopifsae." The drawing is in the style of old handcrafted scientific diagrams.'/>
        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1775</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Blumenbach described five human varieties: Caucasians, Mongolians, Ethiopians, Americans, and Malays. Saini points out that "his arbitrary classification would have lasting consequences," as evidenced by the now-common use of "caucasian" to politely describe whiteness.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1891</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">A classic example of physiognomic literature, it really is remarkable how little this work has changed over the years</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1902</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">This notable entrant to the physiognomic ring features characteristics the author thought were "genuine" and "unreliable." That dichotomy bears a striking resemblance to language used in modern facial recognition papers: "genuine" and "impostor."</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2016</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Two researchers claimed to have trained four classifiers to detect ~criminality~ "based solely on still face images, which is free of any biases of subjective judgments of human observers." Uh-huh. Yeah. Right.

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The pitch: "What if it was possible to know whether an anonymous individual is a potential terrorist, an aggressive person, or a potential criminal? Better yet, what if that information could be obtained and used in real-time, when it matters the most?"

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">In 2018, two researchers created a deep neural network that they claimed could predict a person's sexuality (either gay or straight) based on their face. Turns out straight guys have goatees and straight women wear eyeliner.

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">In September 2020, researchers released the now-infamous facial "trustworthiness" paper. It's garbage for all sorts of reasons.</p>
