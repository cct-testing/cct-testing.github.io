    <p class="intro__content-desc">Why won’t dead  - and violent - ideas just die? Time and again we kill them, debunk them out of existence, but they keep coming back, deadlier than ever, and with alluring new names and claims. Our grandparents called it eugenics, but we call it biometrics. Our forefathers called it craniology and our aunties called it ___ and today the kids call it machine learning. In the 1960’s we thought criminality came from large Y chromosomes but in the 21st century we’re pretty sure it’s kept in the proportions of one’s face. We keep building gadgets to track people we consider risky or deviant, even as...<br><br>

[[emphasizing the consistent through-line across decades. A continuous genealogy of the same intellectual current, while they may seem disparate]]
<br><br>
These zombie ideas are deadly. They are at the core of our violent racist, capitalist, hetero-patriarchical society. So why won’t these dead ideas just die? Because funders, institutions, and companies keep resurrecting them for profit. There are careers to be made in reviving zombie ideas, dealing in death is a profitable trade. And people refuse to learn from the lessons of the past. We keep acting like tired recycled ideas are radical innovations, when really it’s just more of the same.

They claimed that evidence points "toward a genetic factor in conitive ethnic differences" because "blacks and white differ most on tests" measuring "general intelligence," which they characterized as a fixed, inherited index of mental capacity.</p>
